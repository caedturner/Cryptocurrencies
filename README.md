# Cryptocurrencies

### Purpose

The goal of this project is to achieve awareness of all the different cryptocurrencies are available on the trading market and how they can be grouped in order to create a classification system for future investors.

For this analysis i have used unsupervised machine learning models to find trends and classify, based on the fact there is no definative output in which we are evaluating.
